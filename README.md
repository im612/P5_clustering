We suppose we work for an online commerce platform which aims to tailor marketing campaigns to the client's past behaviour. Relying mostly on when they realised their last purchase, how much they spent, in which department and  how they graded their purchasing experience, we develop a segmentation of clients that suits the process of developing a marketing strategy.
